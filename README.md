<!-- Alright so this first line sets up a paragraph which is a HTML way of grouping objects. It also makes a  div tag, meaning it makes
something that encapsulates other things. Here it has multiple classes like sqs-block button-block and sqs-block-button which modify its
appearance in the CSS. There is also an id given that can be referred to in multiple ways in the CSS and HTML. Additionally there is
another div set up but with only one class of sqs-block-content.

Here yet another div is linked to, so there's three capsules with different classes so far.
